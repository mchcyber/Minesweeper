You have a board and you when you click on tile you have three outcomes the first one is you can land on mine and you get a GAMEOVER the second one is that you get a number and this means that within one unit away there is this exact number of bombs around that tile so the numbers are hints telling us how many bombs are nearby , you have to use them to play this game and if you click on a tile where there are no bombs nearby it would expand outwards and check the bounds for the adjacent tiles
